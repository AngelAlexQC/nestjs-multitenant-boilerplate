# Full Stack Monorepo Starter Kit

## Description

This is a monorepo starter kit for full stack applications. It uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.js.org/en/workspaces) to manage dependencies and scripts. Its focus is on providing a simple, yet powerful, development environment for full stack applications avoiding the need to use multiple terminals and/or tools to run the frontend and backend, also providing a common feature set for both.
